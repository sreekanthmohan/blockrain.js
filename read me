The Customer would like to have following Features in the Tertis Game. 
They donâ€™t exist in the Blockrain.js so we need to find a new Template which support these new Features.

1. There need to be Levels, in which the Game gets faster, the higher the levels are, the faster the Block run down the page.
2. Needs to support the functions of the Buttons in the Design. Crosshair (to change direction) and enter Button (To change the block position)
3. Needs to have the Next: Block displayed on the right.
 
The Game need to open in a Pop-up, so that it can be looked at the full width of the device. (PAWECO_Mobiel_view_2_Fullscreen.jpg )
Otherwise the buttons of the Gameboy cannot be pressed, because they are to small, like in this example (PAWECO_Mobiel_view_1_Normal_view.jpg) 

For Desktop or Tablet it can be the normal view, so that the Gameboy is centered.
 
The Game for our Customer should have all the functions of the original Tetris Game. You can play the game here, to see what I mean: https://tetris.com/play-tetris
Here you can see how the original Gameboy Tetris looked like: http://90kids.com/game-boy-tetris/
 
Please find a similar Template to this game, so we can use the PSD Design with that Crosshair and enter Button.
 
Since we need to find a new Template to work with (Since Blockrain.js does not have these Features) the Customer would move the Deadline back, from the 18.10 to the 25.11.
Do you think this timing is Possible? Please confirm so I can replay to the Customer ASAP.

Do you need to have the size Pixel for the desktop/tablet/mobile version, or can you calculate this according to the PSD I sent you? The PSD File is 1000 x 3219 Pixels.

We have identified http://aerolab.github.io/blockrain.js/ for this.
